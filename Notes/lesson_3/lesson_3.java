//! Constructors:

//? Classes can have special methods called constructors
//? A constructor is a method that is automatically called when an object is created.
//? Constructors are used to perform operations at the time an object is created.
//? Constructors typically initialize instance fields and perform other object initialization tasks.

/*
  * Constructors have the same name as the class
  * Constructors have no return type (not even void)
  * Constructors may not return any values
  * Constructors are typically public
