//! Interface

//? An interface is similar to an abstract class that has all abstract methods (It can't be instantiated, and all of the methods listed in an interface must be written eleswhere)
//? The purpose of an interface is to specify behavior for other classes
//? It is often said that an interface is like a "contract", and when a class implements an interface it must adhere to the contract
//? The general format of an interface definition:
/* 
 * public interface InterfaceName{
 * (Method headers)
 * }
 */
