//! Passing objects as arguments:

//? Objects can be passed to methods as arguments
//? Java passes all arguments by value
//? When an object is passed as an argument, the value of the reference variable is passed
//? The value of the reference variable is an address or reference to the object in memory
//? A copy of the object is not passed, just a pointer to the object
//? When a method receives a reference variable as an argument, it is possible for the method to modify the contents of the object referenced by the variable
