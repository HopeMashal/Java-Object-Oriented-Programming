//! What is OOP?

//? OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects"

//? Programming paradigm is a style of programming, a way of thinking about software construction.

//? Programming paradigm doesn't refer to a specific language but rather to a way to build a program or a methodology to apply.

//! Example of previous programming paradigm

//? Procedural Programming: also known as inline programming takes a top-down approach. It is about writing a list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step by step. It relies on procedures or routines.

//? Procedural Programming Example: Program to Calculate Average of array items

// TODO 1: Call to function to accept array data --> Get_input()
// TODO 2: Call to function to caluclate average --> calc_Avg() --> call calc_Sum()
