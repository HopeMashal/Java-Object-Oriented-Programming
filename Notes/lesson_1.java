//! What is OOP?

//? OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects"

//? Programming paradigm is a style of programming, a way of thinking about software construction.

//? Programming paradigm doesn't refer to a specific language but rather to a way to build a program or a methodology to apply.

/*_______________________________*/

//! Example of previous programming paradigm

//? Procedural Programming: also known as inline programming takes a top-down approach. It is about writing a list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step by step. It relies on procedures or routines.

//? Procedural Programming Example: Program to Calculate Average of array items

// TODO 1: Call to function to accept array data --> Get_input()
// TODO 2: Call to function to caluclate average --> calc_Avg() --> call calc_Sum()

//! OBJECT:

//? Object is a thing (Tangible - Intangible)

//? Example: Objects is student housing management program
// TODO: Student --> name,address, phone number, gender, ...etc
// TODO: Room --> area, floor number, view, ...etc
// TODO: Building --> building number, number of floors, for whom (student,teacher,...etc)
// TODO: Furniture --> id, price, ...etc

//? Example: Objects in College Management Program
// TODO: Student --> name,address, phone number, gender, ...etc
// TODO: Course --> material, books, ...etc
// TODO: Teacher --> name,address, phone number, gender, certificate, majorm, ...etc
// TODO: Class --> building, room, ...etc
// TODO: Grading Report --> Quizes, HomeWork, ...etc
